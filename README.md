# Research in Incompleteness in Visual Analytics
A curated list of current research in visual analystics focusing on types of incompleteness.

# Data-Centric Research

#### Imputation Methodology

- [Effects of Missing Data in Social Networks](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Effects-of-missing-data-in-social-networks-Kossinets/cbf9f900faee20d716ecc288eedc48e6e0fc04ba): An exploration of how different missingness mechanisms impact social networks (and metrics!).

#### Incompleteness is Visualized With Color

- [Research Directions in Data Wrangling: Visualizations and Transformations for Usable and Credible Data](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1473871611415994): studied the differences in perception between interpolating, omitting, zero filling, and visualizing with color

#### Visualizing Incomplete Relationships

- [Exploring incomplete data using visualization techniques](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11634-011-0102-y): Researchers explore the relationship between incomplete data and the visualizations they produce in the VIM package.

### Machine Learning in Visual Analytics
- [NNVA: Neural Network Assisted Visual Analysis of Yeast Cell Polarization Simulation](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/NNVA%3A-Neural-Network-Assisted-Visual-Analysis-of-Hazarika-Li/d424d2a1585d49eb52fb3aae3168b000f5992aad): Machine learning in visual analytics to simulate the production of yeast cells.
# Human-Centric Research

#### Brushing and Linking Research

#### Tools and Software for Working With Uncertainty
- [GraphTrail: Analyzing Large Multivariate, Heterogeneous Networks while Supporting Exploration History](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/graphtrail_chi2012.pdf): software that enables exploratory visual analysis of networks.

- [MyBrush: Brushing and Linking with Personal Agency](https://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/supplemental/MyBrush/2018_VIS_mybrush.pdf): MyBrush is a tool used for brushing and linking for visual analytics.

- [VisLink: Revealing Relationships Amongst Visualizations](http://vialab.science.uoit.ca/portfolio/vislink-revealing-relationships-amongst-visualizations): VisLink is a tool for visualizing relationships between different visualizations.

- [Visual Exploration of Multivariate Graphs ](http://vis.berkeley.edu/files/chi06/Wattenberg_p811.pdf): A tool for exploring graphs with mulitple layers of complexity.

- [Interactive visualization for missing values, time series, and areal data](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f8b5/26fb936fc25ca10c004deb4db667c29f9c5a.pdf): An analysis of specific data visualizations and a new R package for visualizing missing data.

#### Cognition of Incompleteness

- [Why Authors Don't Visualize Uncertainty](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/Value_of_Uncertainty_Vis_CR.pdf): a statistical study on the resaons why data practitioners choose not to visualize uncertainty.

- [Decision-Making Under Uncertainty in Research Synthesis: Designing for the Garden of Forking Paths](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02957.pdf): a model and study of decision making, conceptualizing the process as a "garden of forking paths." 

#### Multi-Dimensional Visual Analytics
- [Visual Abstraction and Exploration of Multi-class Scatterplots](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6875982): a tool to aid visualization of multi-dimensional scatterplots, usually prone to problems in visual analysis.

#### Visual Analytics and the Arts, Sports, etc.

- [Designing Visual Guides for Casual Listeners of Live Orchestral Music](https://vimeo.com/368187805): Researchers break down several dimensions of how to listen to classical music and explore the best way to present their findings to casual classical music goers.

- [scenery: Flexible Virtual Reality Visualization on the Java VM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06726.pdf): Virtual reality and visual analytics combine in an interactive setting.

- [ForVizor: Visualizing Spatio-Temporal Team Formations in Soccer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30136977/): Visual analysis of spatio-temporal team formations.

- [Art, Affect and Color: Creating Engaging Expressive Scientific Visualization](https://sciviscolor.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2018/10/art-affect-color-opt.pdf): Researchers explore the relationships between color and affect in an interesting paper focusing on the artistic elements of visualizations.

# Research in Incompleteness in Visual Analytics
A curated list of current research in visual analystics focusing on types of incompleteness.

# Data-Centric Research

#### Imputation Methodology

#### Incompleteness is Visualized With Color

# Human-Centric Research

#### Brushing and Linking Research



#### Tools and Software for Working With Uncertainty
-[GraphTrail: Analyzing Large Multivariate, Heterogeneous Networks while Supporting Exploration History](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/graphtrail_chi2012.pdf): software that enables exploratory visual analysis of networks.

-[MyBrush: Brushing and Linking with Personal Agency](https://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/supplemental/MyBrush/2018_VIS_mybrush.pdf): MyBrush is a tool used for brushing and linking for visual analytics.

#### Cognition of Incompleteness

- [Why Authors Don't Visualize Uncertainty](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/Value_of_Uncertainty_Vis_CR.pdf): a statistical study on the resaons why data practitioners choose not to visualize uncertainty.

-[Decision-Making Under Uncertainty in Research Synthesis: Designing for the Garden of Forking Paths](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02957.pdf): a model and study of decision making, conceptualizing the process as a "garden of forking paths."
